             48 hours and must not exceed the maximum period of 14 days.<br /><br />

            The lender must make a statement before loan in the appropriate part of the Antaris Legacy forum. There must be a member of staff has confirmed the loan before the player "Receiver"

            During the term of the loan, the lender shall not connect to the account, refer to the paragraph of the collaborative stewardship (if the lender connects the end of the loan
             he has stated on the forum, then it will prevent the same subject via the premature termination of the loan).<br /><br />

            The lender must trust the other player to make a loan account. The staff is not responsible for the actions to be performed on behalf of the creditor (deletion planet, changing the password, or just outright deleting the account).<br /><br />

           Finally, the loan account does not negate the rules of multi-account trading, and shared stewardship. An account that has been paid can not be again until a minimum of the last loan period multiplied by 2 (that is to say if you made a loan of 4 days, then it will be eight days before a new loan is possible).

            To transact business, you must first both players have a pact. The pact can be automatic
             (that is to say, two players who are in the same alliance did not need to do pact between them in order to trade, as well,
             for two players who are in alliances "friends").<br /><br />

            It is strictly forbidden to send resources to a strong player without a fair return (compliance rate of trade) within 48 hours after the first shipment.

            Trade between two players must meet the following rates (with a 25% error margin) to be fair :

                <li>Resource : 4 unités de Fer = 3 unités d’Or = 2 unités de Cristal = 1 unités de Elyrium.</li>

                <li>Population : 1 unité de formation = 20 unités de Fer.</li>
            </ul>

            Exchange lasts maximum 48 hours. However, if at the end of this period, the exchange is made ​​still unfair, then the system will give you a push time
             additional 24 hours to put you in good standing. After these 24 hours, if the exchange is always unfair, you must apply for a push on the forum in the appropriate section.
             A moderator will handle your request and process issues, in each case, (this does not mean that you can be banned for non-compliance with the rule).<br /><br />

            If you are in an irregular situation after an unfair exchange is completed (72 hours passed) and you have not done a "push request" on the forum, then the two
             offending accounts will be punished without notice.<br /><br />

            Players have at their disposal a page letting them know if their trade is fair or not. To do this, go to the "Trade" page, then "Push" tab.<br /><br /> 

            An account that is only used in order to supply another, will be banned for life, and the "receiver" account will be punished in an exemplary manner.
