1 => 'Iron is a resource present in large quantities on the different world of the universe. This is the most commonly used raw material. Required initially to build rudimentary buildings, iron will prove useful later in the development of technologies, but also for the construction of vessels. Develop iron mines is therefore essential for any empire. However, this wealth does not remain effective in the long term, once the sources of surface iron and underutilized land. You will therefore have to dig much deeper into the core of the planet to find more iron, using an extractor available at level 20.',
2 => 'Gold has for centuries been one of the most coveted resources. Its specific capabilities makes him very useful in the manufacture of electrical, computer and electromagnetic systems, as well as in the various buildings and technologies. Synonymous with wealth and rarity, gold is now a little easier to find resource, through individual farms infrastructure available. Exploitation of gold mine is essential to any empire. Gold Mine allows for gold buried underground has little depth, but most developed construction of these mines is very long and is not very profitable, you will develop gold extractors once the level reached 20.',
3 => 'Crystal is a very solid ore. It is usually found in deep, near the heart of the planets. Very difficult to access and rarely surface, the crystal is a very valuable and coveted ore. It is used in construction technology and advanced vessels, some essential equipment and in the construction of several major infrastructure upon reaching a higher technological level. The fact that it is found mainly in depth, it will be necessary to build extractors once reached level 20 to increase your production profitably and enjoy the natural resources of your planet.',
4 => 'The construction of buildings on your planet requires to produce energy in order to power them. The solar power plant is a power plant with power, consisting of a circular field of solar panels and a tower in the center. It recovers solar energy through its many reflectors, converts it into electricity, and sends its output to the building of your planet.',
5 => 'Exploring different worlds, you have found a technology belonging to the great race of Antaris. This is a software controller in the form of seat. The seat control acts as mental interface with individuals possessing the genes Antaris. Powered by an energy modulator or a reactor elyrium, this platform is mainly used to control the drones Antaris, and accelerate the process of technology development and construction of buildings, ships and aircraft.',
6 => 'Shortens research time each level by 8%.',
7 => 'Iron mines were soon found to be ineffective in the raw material requirements of important colonial empires. The study of extraction methods has allowed researchers to develop your infrastructure permetant a deep extraction, and directly under your iron mines. Construction of a building of this class is long and expensive, but will pay for itself quickly, increasing your production through extractors dramatically.',
8 => 'The gold deposits are poor, and a large empire can not satisfy her needs first with classical vein. The extraction is the only solution to a certain level. Extractor or draws directly into the molten magma from the center of the planet. Various methods, coupled with thermonuclear reactions depths to extract pure liquid gold directly usable. Construction of a building of this class is long and expensive, but will pay for itself quickly, increasing your production through extractors dramatically.',
9 => 'Rare in surface veins crystals are quickly exploited and depleted by mining. The extractor is the only solution when the production of crystal becomes too thin compared to the need of an empire. The extraction process is too long and tedious, scientists have developed a revolutionary extraction technology. However, it is relatively long compared to other known extraction vector. The technique is to grind the crystal directly to the location of your old mines. Weather researchers then use gravity to separate the crystal of other residues. The crystal mash is then heated to be stored. In addition to this new technique used in an extractor, it helps get the ore buried deep underground, where they are much more present on the surface. Construction of a building of this class is long and expensive, but will pay for itself quickly, increasing your production through extractors dramatically.',
11 => 'conventional extraction elyrium in mines is very long and tedious. A type of extraction has been developed, the latter being longer to develop. You must have a perfect knowledge extraction for hope to build a drilling system stable. Unlike other, the process is conventional. Drilling is carried out to find a rich elyrium area. Once it is found, the huge drill station will pierce the crusts several miles deep, where the precious substance will rise',
10 => 'The geothermal plant is a major power supply station. Generally built on land or on the seabed, it is intended to pull the drilling means geothermal energy from the ground to the supply infrastructure from your planet. Its production is much higher than that of a single solar panel.',
12 => 'The fusion reactor uses deuterium to produce energy.',
14 => 'Robotic factories provide construction robots to aid in the construction of buildings. Each level increases the speed of the upgrade of buildings',
15 => 'This is the ultimate in robotics technology. Each level cuts the construction time for buildings, ships, and defenses',
21 => 'Very quickly, all eyes turned to heaven. This vastness offers the fastest Empires ability to grow at a prodigious rate, expanding their business affinities, and of course bellicose. The spatial database allows you to build any type of vessels: the simplest (as hunters) to the more powerful, such as destroyers. By increasing the level of your space base, you will unlock new types of devices, and you will decrease the build time for your ships.',
22 => 'Storage resources is critical to the continued development of your Empire. Expand your iron deposits and can store more of this raw material, building large reservoirs on and below the surface..',

25 => 'Storage resources is critical to the continued development of your Empire. Expand your deposits elyrium allows and store more of this raw material. Storing elyrium is done in two ways: the ore is directly placed under vacuum to maintain its energy properties. Eventually, the storage will be in liquid form, such as gold, in special capsules.',
31 => 'The Antaris left in the galaxy numerous technologies. For replay value, it will need the appropriate infrastructure (research laboratory test center). The lab is actually made up of several buildings, and its level is high, more researchers will be able to work.',
33 => 'The process of terraforming can change the appearance of a planet and make it habitable hitherto unusable entire regions. The surface of the planet can be rearranged as to best match your needs. Terraforming allows to gain additional seats (25 slots) on terraformed planet.',

44 => 'missile silos used for storage of rockets.',
45 => 'One of the most important facets in the demarcation of the great colonial empires remains foremost military power. Training new recruits in all aspects of the war, whether the fighter base, the engineer or the military researcher, is a way to prove that military power. The barracks is an important building for any empire wishing to expand and colonize. The more your barracks high, the more you can train staff.',

46 => 'The need for protection has become a priority in the major confrontations of the Galaxy. The Antaris left behind an incredible defensive armament. You still have to rediscover it, and develop it throughout your empire. The defense building you can reduce the time to build your infrastructure defenses (available in the Defenses menu).',
47 => 'Outpost is the living Antaris advanced military control. The infrastructure includes a seat that controls the drones, real asset in attacks. Only Antaris can control them.',
 48 => 'Recognizable by its characteristic blue color, elyrium is a crystalline solid, named after the place it was first discovered on the planet Elyria. This particularly rare mineral has a unique ability to absorb energy and restitution. Able to absorb most of the radiation to build up their energy and be able to quickly restore the elyrium, besides being a universal accumulator is an extremely valuable and powerful superconductor. Its use must be rigorous and monitored. The element may indeed saturate and explode if supply energy radiation is too high. Indeed these extraordinary properties, elyrium is the only source capable of supplying a hyperspace engine for example. It is particularly important for scientific and technological research, and is used as fuel for ships. It is rare to find a surface and even underground. You will construct an extractor at 20 your mine to have more chance to find and produce.',

111 => 'Special alloys improve the armour on ships and defensive structures. The effectiveness of the armour can be increased by 10 % per level.',
113 => 'The energy efficiency has always been a key issue for all civilizations and a great vehicle for conflict, because who has the energy has the power. In less developed civilizations as human civilization, there is a fossil energy research, but reached a certain technological stage, civilizations must develop new sources of energy that do not use mineral, such as generators ions / or energy neutrinos Arkanniens Modulators Antaris because schooled the inexhaustible source of energy will become invincible.',
114 => 'By integrating the 4th and 5th dimensions it is now possible to research a new kind of drive that is more economical and efficient.',
115 => 'Combustion reactors are the most primitive space reactors listed to date. They allow a significant acceleration as little advanced civilizations such as the human civilization, used to send objects into orbit. These reactors thus produce a chemical reaction that propels the object in a direction opposite to that of the reactors, the acceleration is important, but limited, and even some advanced civilizations quickly find the limits of this system, as it does not achieve faster speeds for space travel, and asks some very important developments in order to transport fuel',
117 => 'Ion propulsion is also a relatively primitive propulsion, since civilization as the human civilization can expand, it is to accelerate projecting a molecule in the plasma state after it has been ionized in the reactor. So this drive does not allow a significant acceleration as combustion engines and turns out to be unable to identify an object of attraction of a planet, but it allows to reach speeds quite as much as that can provide chemical propulsion. A civilization sufficiently develop as Hébridans may consider improving this propulsion order to approach the speed of light, and also enable the vessels equipped only with ion thruster to dispose of a global attraction.',
118 => 'The hypernavigation is the most powerful system currently in use to move a ship from one planet to another without external system to the ship. It requires a large amount of material to enable the creation of a stable subspace bubble. The hypernavigation allows your ships to achieve supra-Luminary speed and so move through the universe. There are two main types of hypernavigation, the first is interstellar hypernavigation, and the second is intergalactic hypernavigation. The interstellar hypernavigation is often described as primitive hypernavigation because it only allows to move the solar system to solar because of its low-speed system',

140 => 'Sufficiently advanced civilization eventually deplete natural resources upper layers of the planet where it is located. To counter this universal phenomenon, peoples like Antaris developed impressive technologies in the field of mineral extraction, and energy. By implementing scientific and technical research on the extraction, you will increase your resource production.',
141 => 'The control room is a key element in an empire. This is the core of the empire which are managed buildings, technological research, the movement of vessels. In addition, the control room is connected to each control room of your ships allowing a direct link with all your forces in the universe.',
142 => 'Mastering the subspace is a grave moment for all civilizations. This control allows vessels to move to a supra-Luminary speed. This technology allows using a generator to create a space around an object making it possible to travel at speeds exceeding the speed of light. And control of sub-space allows all civilizations to acquire a galactic influence, even for the most powerful intergalactic. This technology also allows to connect two planets located several light years in a short time, favoring extrasolar colonization and development of a civilization spread across the stars.',
143 => 'Knowledge of particles has been, is and will always be a major area of research for all civilizations, all particles with very different and amazing features. The search for new particles has allowed people such as Arkans, develop generators ions / neutrinos or Drahks to move their fleet through elyrium and possibly to elyrium  when its operation was understood. For particulates can be used to create new alloys for the hulls of vessels, ground and space infrastructure and the development of innovative medical systems and painless',
144 => 'The Antaris have left us a legacy technology ... quite complex, and to better understand and control their technology, put your best researchers on the spot and use their discoveries to your advantage. Their knowledge will allow you to evolve much faster than the norm.',
145 => 'Civilizations wishing to expand into the galaxy and have some influence had to create a fleet. To this end, they had to invest heavily in research infrastructure, durable, and most massive potential. And research infrastructure proves to be a vital link in the conquest of space.',
146 => 'Virus Portal allows initially weaken the force field of it, making it more vulnerable to a second attack technology. In a second step, therefore, it alters the force field and renders inoperable, permitting access to the planet referred to your troops for a period relative. However, if target foe has a force field strengthened, it will be impossible to lower the field and through the gate. Then you have to invest in a more powerful virus.',
147 => 'This technology is used to protect the gate teleportation. A force field encircling the latter, preventing the material passing through the gateway to recover the other side. The force field thus prevents hostile visits to your planet. However, an enemy more technologically advanced than you might have a virus countering the force field of your gate, allowing his troops to invade you. It is therefore necessary to strengthen your force field to ensure the safety of your world.',
148 => 'The war of espionage and spying against quickly found its limitations, the empires are becoming more responsive to external aggressions. It was therefore necessary to find new ways to protect the vital information of your planets. Your scientists have found this method through shading, highly advanced technology and extremely efficient. It finds use in many areas: whether the optical camouflage of your ships with the properties of light, scrambling your data with a revolutionary encryption ... Each level can improve these techniques, making more effective. Thus, your opponents will see less and less information about your fleet when you will attack.',
149 => 'The concealment has become a primary means to carry out surprise attacks. One way to deal with this technology has been rapidly implemented by your research department. Concealment is a means of optical camouflage, or data encryption, the only effective way to counter it is to improve your detection systems. Your old radars have been converted into interstellar powerful sensors that can detect the slightest irregularity in several light years away from their position, and penetrate enemy computers. An indirect way is to measure the gravitational fields of celestial bodies permanently, meaning that an irregularity fleet is probably transiting the area. Improving this technology should be taken as soon as possible to protect themselves from the effects of adverse occultation.',

The reactor produces indeed sufficient energy charge to power a portal by itself. It also allows power the Antaris Hq for 24 hours, if you do not have an energy modulator.',
222 => 'The energy modulator is a small reserve of energy in size but very significant power. Coming from the Antaris technology for powering Before Post Office, City and See, it is very difficult to find by exploring the planets, but with advanced technology, and knowledge of Antaris thrust, your scientists will able to build so you can power more easily and longer the seat of your planet. The energy modulator makes it possible to power a Antaris seat for a period of 31 days without interruption. But its design requires to invest a substantial amount of resources.',
